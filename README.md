# Movie Recommendation System

# Overview
This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using Python with Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for visualization, and Gradio for creating an interactive user interface. The system allows users to select their preferred movie genres and spoken language to receive tailored movie recommendations based on a dataset of movies.

# Main Files and Their Functions
•	app.py: The main script that integrates all functionalities, handles user inputs, processes data, and manages the Gradio interface.
•	MyMovies.csv: The dataset containing information about movies, including titles, genres, spoken languages, and average ratings.
•	requirements.txt: A file that lists all the necessary Python packages required to run the project.

# Dataset
The Movies dataset is a comprehensive collection of movie-related information designed to provide valuable insights into various films. The system uses a CSV file named MyMovies.csv, which contains details about movies, including:
•	Title
•	Genres
•	Spoken Languages
•	Average Ratings

# Features
•	Genre and Language Selection: Users can select one or multiple genres and a specific spoken language to filter movie recommendations.
•	Data Visualization: The average ratings of movies by genre are visualized using a horizontal bar chart.
•	Interactive Interface: Built with Gradio, the interface is user-friendly and responsive, making it accessible on various devices.

# Visualization
The system also generates a bar chart showing the average rating of movies by genre, helping users understand which genres tend to be rated higher.
